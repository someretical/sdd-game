How to play:
---

WASD to move

m1 to shoot

m2 to dodge roll in the currently moving direction

q to blank (remove ALL bullets on screen + maybe reveal a secret room?)

e to interact

stand in exit node for 3 seconds to go to next floor (marked as green dot on minimap)

tab to view fullscreen map

scroll to zoom in and out while fullscreen map is up

these are the basic instructions to get started, but there are a bunch of other mechanics that can be explored but are not needed to survive
